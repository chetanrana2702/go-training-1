# Concurrency

**This [page] links to resources for learning about concurrency in Go. The items are presented in order, from beginner material to advanced topics.**

*Making progress on more than one task simultaneously is known as concurrency. Go has rich support for concurrency using goroutines and channels.*  
```
import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
/*
    Will print:
    world
    hello
    hello
    world
    world
    hello
    hello
    world
    world
    hello
*/
```

With a goroutine we return immediately to the next line and don't wait for the function to complete.


##### Concurrency vs. parallelism

### Channels
Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, <-.
```
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
           // assign value to v.
```
*Channels provide a way for two goroutines to communicate with one another and synchronize their execution:*
[Channels example](../src/10-concurrency/channels.go)           

Go has a special statement called select which works like a switch but for channels:
[select example](../src/10-concurrency/select.go)
