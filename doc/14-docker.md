# Docker

*Containers are standalone software packages that bundle an application with all its dependencies, tools, libraries, runtime, configuration files, and anything else necessary to run the application.*

*Containers abstract away the application from any of the environments that they will run on. That means, containerized apps run consistently across environments from dev to staging to production.*

## Docker containers with Go and RabbitMq
#### Example:
- See: [docker-compose.yml](../src/16-docker/docker-compose.yml) and the [example configuration](../src/16-docker/)
- Go to path `src/16-docker` and execute:
    - `docker-compose up`
- Visit:
    - [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to send a message
    - [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672) is the RabbitMq admin (admin/1234)

#### Commands found in the Dockerfile

```
# copy the local project code into a directory in work dir directory
COPY web-app.go .

# set this to the working directory so all subsequent commands will run from this directory
WORKDIR /go/src/app

# install all dependencies
RUN go get ./

# build the binary
RUN go build
```
